# YesWeCAN

YesWeCAN is an implementation of a suit of statistical models developed to study the evolution of overlapping reading frames in genetic data. This project formed a major component of my Ph.D. research work at UCL.

In a wide range of organisms, multiple protein-coding sequences can be found overlapping at a single genetic locus, occupying different reading frames. Conventional selection analysis tools will produce false positives if applied in this situation, because they cannot account for selection acting on multiple frames. Indeed, several published studies have wrongly inferred positive selection in overlapping coding sequences for this reason. Previous attempts to produce adequate models for the purpose have been either heuristic or too computationally expensive for routine use. We have developed a new likelihood approach which infers selection pressure on overlapping coding sequences on a singe DNA strand using novel `codon aware' nucleotide substitution models.
